# Tuberculosis Patient Dashboard — Data Analysis Project

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes Tuberculosis (TB) patient data to uncover health trends, treatment patterns, and risk factors affecting patient outcomes.
The dashboard provides an interactive visual summary of patient demographics, symptoms, treatment duration, drug resistance, and overall treatment outcomes across different states in Nigeria.
The goal is to support healthcare stakeholders in:
- Monitoring TB spread
-	Evaluating treatment effectiveness
-	Identifying high-risk groups
-	Improving public health interventions

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/solution8118/Tuberculosis-Patient-Dashboard/blob/main/TB_Patients_Nigeria_Sample.xlsx">Dataset</a>

### Dataset Summary:

- Total Patients: 1,000

- Average Treatment Duration: 10.7 months

- Coverage: Multiple states in Nigeria

#### Variables include:
- Gender
- Age Group
- HIV Status
- Smoking Status
- Symptoms
- Drug Resistance Type
-Treatment Outcome
- Treatment Duration

##  Questions (KPIs)
The dashboard answers the following key healthcare questions:
- What is the total number of TB patients?
- What is the average treatment duration?
- How are patients distributed across states?
- Which symptoms are most common?
- What age groups are most affected?
- What is the gender distribution of patients?
- How many patients are smokers vs non-smokers?
- What percentage of TB patients are HIV positive?
- What types of drug resistance are recorded?
- What are the treatment outcomes?
- How long does treatment typically last by month category?

## Project Process
### 1. Data Collection

The TB dataset was obtained in Excel format containing patient medical and demographic records.

### 2. Data Cleaning
Performed in Excel:
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized state names
- Cleaned categorical fields (Gender, HIV status, Smokers)
- Checked missing values
- Formatted treatment duration fields

### 3. Data Transformation
- Grouped patients by age brackets
- Categorized symptoms
- Aggregated treatment outcomes
- Calculated averages and totals

### 4. Data Visualization
Built an interactive dashboard in Excel/Power BI featuring:
- Pie Charts
- Bar Charts
- Donut Charts
- Treemap
- Map Visualization
- KPI Cards

## 🔄 Workflow Summary
- Imported dataset into Excel
- Cleaned and validated records
- Created pivot tables
- Built calculated metrics (KPIs)
- Designed dashboard layout
- Added slicers for interactivity
- Finalized healthcare insights report

## Key Insights

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Patient Demographics
Male and female patients are nearly evenly distributed.
The most affected age group is 15–24, followed closely by 65–74 and 45–54.

### 🗺️ Geographic Distribution
TB cases are spread across multiple states.
States like Kaduna, Kano, Lagos, and Rivers show higher patient concentrations.

### 🦠 HIV & Smoking Risk Factors
A notable portion of TB patients are HIV positive, confirming comorbidity risk.
Majority of patients are non-smokers, though smokers remain a significant minority risk group.

### 🤒 Symptoms Analysis
Most reported symptoms include:
- Weight Loss
- Chest Pain
- Persistent Cough
- Fever
- Fatigue
- Night Sweats
- Weight loss and chest pain appear among the most frequent indicators.

### 💊 Drug Resistance
Most patients are drug sensitive.
Smaller portions show:
- MDR (Multi-Drug Resistant)
- XDR (Extensively Drug Resistant)
This indicates resistance exists but is not dominant.

### ⏳ Treatment Duration
The highest treatment volume occurs around 6 months.
Patient counts decline as treatment duration increases to 24 months.

### ✅ Treatment Outcomes
Breakdown shows:
- Completed: 185
- Failed: 175
- Ongoing: 171
- Cured: 159
- Died: 158
- Lost to follow-up: 152
Completion rates are highest, but failure and mortality remain concerning.
